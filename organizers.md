    <p>Davide Momi is a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow affiliated both at Precision Neurotherapeutics Lab at Stanford University and th GriffLab at CAMH (Toronto). Dr. Momi obtained his Ph.D. from the Department of Neuroscience, Imaging, and Clinical Sciences at the University G. d'Annunzio of Chieti. During his doctoral studies, he had the opportunity to conduct research as a visiting Ph.D. student at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Momi has extensive experience in analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data, brain stimulation applications, electrophysiology and machine learning. Additionally, Dr. Momi has a growing passion for simulating network-level macroscale brain dynamics. The overarching objective of his project is to advance our ability to predict brain stimulation outcomes through the integration of computational, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological approaches.</p>
