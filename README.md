# Whole-brain, Connectome-based Models of Brain Dynamics: From Principles to Applications

This is the official Repository of the OHBM's Educational Course entitled Whole-brain, Connectome-based Models of Brain Dynamics: From Principles to Applications organized by Dr. Davide Momi, Dr. John Griffiths & Dr. Joana Cabral


![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GriffithsLab/OHBM-educational-course/gh-pages/logo.png)

Our aim is to provide an advanced yet accessible showcase of, and introduction to, the latest cutting-edge work in whole-brain (also known as ‘large-scale’ or ‘connectome-based’) network modelling in contemporary human brain mapping research. This field represents an integrative convergence of data, concepts, and techniques from structural+functional neuroimaging, systems+cognitive neuroscience, dynamical systems+network science, neurology+psychiatry, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.

The course is divided in 3 sections. Each section will have 2-3 tutorial lectures, and importantly also conclude with a ~1hr hands-on session, where participants spend time working through pre-prepared tutorial code, pertaining to one or more of the preceding lectures.
Please find below the full program.
