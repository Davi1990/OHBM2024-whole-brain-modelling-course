She is keenly interested in understanding the general principles underlying brain function to elucidate how the mind emerges from the brain’s functional organization. Her research aims to characterize the fundamental biophysical mechanisms and principles underlying intrinsic brain states and higher cognitive functions in health, and their breakdown in disease. To achieve this, Dr. Cruzat combines behavioral and neuroimaging data analysis with in silico generative mathematical modeling. Dr. Cruzat’s approach will help identify and link brain states, in terms of large-scale cortical network dynamics, with states of mind. This research has the potential to offer biomarkers for diagnosis and enable novel therapeutic interventions to treat dysfunctional mental states.</p>
